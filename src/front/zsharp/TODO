- talk to AO about bit-split

- remove ret requirement for fns - typecheck with bool if no type (and test
  function_call() for compatibility!)

- unify_inline_array revisit

- const / non-const cleanup

- casts
    - widening casts are free!
    - check narrowing cast correctness!
    - look at unpack functions again

- stdlib rename to avoid confusion with parallel ZoK checkouts
    [x] and/or: check ZSHARP_STDLIB_PATH envvar

- generic inf: monomorphize at call time

- add explicit-generic-expr

- POW width - allow full width operand once we have range analysis

- optimization: for a < b, only expand a to b's bit width;
  a < b is (a_expansion == a) && (a_expansion < b_expansion)
