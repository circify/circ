- talk to AO about bit-split

- const / non-const cleanup

- casts
    - widening casts are free!
    - check narrowing cast correctness!
    - look at unpack functions again

- add explicit-generic-expr to parser, e,g., foo::<(N+1)>(5)

- POW width - allow full width operand once we have range analysis

- optimization: for a < b, only expand a to b's bit width;
  a < b is (a_expansion == a) && (a_expansion < b_expansion)

- field div / divrem
    - impl unsigned
    - think about signed

- multi-returns?

== done ==

[x] generic inf: monomorphize at call time
    [x] make sure we got a UNIQUE solution! find_unique_model() fn

- stdlib rename to avoid confusion with parallel ZoK checkouts
    [x] and/or: check ZSHARP_STDLIB_PATH envvar

[WONTFIX] remove ret requirement for fns
  - typecheck with bool if no type? (and test function_call() for compatibility)
  - add () or nil type?

[x] unify_inline_array revisit
