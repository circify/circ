overloading: 
    Functions are imported by name. If many functions have the same name
    but different signatures, all of them get imported, and which one to
    use in a particular call is inferred. (ZoK manual section 3.8)
  ==> we disallow explicitly

inferred types for decimal literals (ZoK manual section 3.2)
    inside expressions
    in assignments if LHS
    add "untypedInteger" and unify as we go?
  ==> handled

multi-assignment
  ==> not implemented (WONTFIX?)

generics
  ==> handled, but with edge cases

add array-membership operator
add arithmetic-progression literal (to use with array-membership op)
should we make range checks explicit in IR?
    we have power-of-2 right now
    add non-power-of-2 range check?

// Following is totally broken right now (may work in ref compiler because
// they seem to monomorphize on-the-fly --- consider doing this?)

def last<N>(u32[N] a) -> u32:
    return a[N-1]

def foo<N>(u32[N] a) -> u32:
    // can't compute 2*N and pass to last because it has to be a const value!
    // (and cannot declare const values inside functions)
    return last([...a, ...a])

def main() -> u32:
    return foo([1,2,3])

// XXX do we want to add const decls *inside* functions?
//     not possible right now, but could help for cases like this
