# ZoKrates Syntax Highlighter

This is a Textmate-based syntax highlighter for the [ZoKrates language](https://zokrates.github.io) in VSCode.

## Development

This project expect the syntax to be provided as a JSON file (see `syntaxes`).
As working with a YAML file instead is easier, it can make sense to convert to that and back.
VSCode offers a command `Convert to {JSON, YAML}-tmLanguage File` that achieves that.

## Release process

This extension is currently released manually to the VSCode extension marketplace.
